# Machine Learning Projects

Here, you will find a collection of my worked-out projects, which were created using *Jupyter Notebooks* or *Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio*.

* Each project is organized into its own folder, and includes all necessary files and resources. 
Additionally, I have included detailed documentation within each project folder to provide context and clarity around my methodology and results.
